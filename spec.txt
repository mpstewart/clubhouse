Anyone can see posts

Only members can see author names

Questions:
  What do we do when someone isn't logged in?
    Well, posts#show should probably just prompt them to log in


Behavior:
  'users/#{user_id}' should show that user's posts
  'posts/' should show all recent posts
    -> SQL queries?
